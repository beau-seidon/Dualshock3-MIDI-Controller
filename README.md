# Dualshock3-MIDI-Controller
ESP32 firmware to convert Dualshock3 bluetooth input to MIDI commands

The latest commit is fully functional and tested and very fun to play with. I still need to update this readme with details about how to configure the ESP32 to talk to a PS3 controller, and how to use it once connected. That's a tomorrow problem.
